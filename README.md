# Rollin Server

Backend server for the Rollin Attendance Apps project â€” part of my thesis work on an Attendance Management System.

This repository contains the server-side implementation that provides APIs and services used by the Rollin mobile and web clients. It is implemented in Kotlin and includes static front-end assets and a Dockerfile for containerized deployments.

Key goals (thesis context)
- Serve as the central backend for recording and managing attendance data.
- Demonstrate a scalable, secure architecture as part of an academic thesis on attendance management systems.
- Provide endpoints for authentication, attendance recording, reporting, and administration.

Core features
- RESTful API for attendance operations (check-in, check-out, session management)
- User and role management (admins, instructors, students)
- Reporting endpoints for attendance summaries and exports
- JWT-based authentication (configurable secret)
- Containerization support via Docker

Tech stack
- Kotlin (server)
- HTML (static assets)
- Docker (deployment)

Quick start (development)
Prerequisites: JDK 11+ or 17+, Docker (optional), and a database (Postgres or other supported DB).

1. Set environment variables (example):
   - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/dbname
   - JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   - PORT=8080

2. Build and run locally (Gradle):
   ./gradlew build
   java -jar build/libs/rollin-server.jar

3. With Docker:
   docker build -t rollin-server .
   docker run -e DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" -e JWT_SECRET="$JWT_SECRET" -p 8080:8080 rollin-server

Testing
- Run tests with: ./gradlew test

Configuration
- Place configuration in environment variables or in a config file as your environment requires. Common variables: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, PORT.
